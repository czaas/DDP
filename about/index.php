            <p>Drafting & Design Plus (DDP) was established by Dave Jones in 1991 to provide shop and fabrication drawings for windows, storefronts, window walls, curtain walls, and metal panel systems to the commercial glazing industry. After a career that began in 1968 at Soule Steel Co., Curtain Wall Division, where I began as an extrusion die draftsman, I continued my career in the industry as an estimator and project manager for some of the largest and most reputable glass companies in the United States and was involved in the construction of some of the largest commercial building projects in the US and around the world. In 1989, due to my inability to find a quality and dependable drafting service I purchased a license of AutoCAD R10 and began doing my own design work. That work led to my starting my own drafting business in 1991. In 2010 after 19 years of producing shop drawing submittals with AutoCAD I decided to convert drawing production to Revit 3D BIM software and have in the last 4+ years provided 3D models and shop drawing output for some major glazing projects with great success. Currently DDP can provide shop drawing or design output in the following formats: .rvt, .dwg, .nwd, .nwc, .pdf, or .dwf(x). I am fully able to provide complete 3D models for any glazing project with any glazed framing or metal panel system scope of work and am able to work closely with project design teams to provide clash detection, coordination, and virtual building services.</p>
            <p>DDP also provides GPS locational services for framing and panel point locations using Trimble Field Point software. The inclusion of locating points in the provided 3D model enable your field personnel to quickly and accurately locate all required work points any place on a project. Output is provided in a form useable by Trimble Field Link or LM80 GPS equipment. This service is provided at no additional cost to DDP customers where required.</p>
            <p>DDP provides submittal packages produced with AutoCAD 2015 or 3D BIM models with subsequent submittal drawings produced with Revit 2012 to 2015 as required by the project BIM Execution Plan. DDP provides structural calculations, if required, for all projects and our Structural Engineer is licensed in all 50 states.</p>
